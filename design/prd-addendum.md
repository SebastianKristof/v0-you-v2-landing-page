## 🔧 What Makes You.v2 Different (New Section)

> You.v2 is not therapy. It's not coaching. It's not healing. It's **structural subconscious reprogramming** — built for people who've done the hard work and now need to clear the last invisible layer that's still running the show.

**Key Differentiators:**

* Structured 17-day sprint, not open-ended process
* Uses proven subconscious methods (regression, parts work) but framed as personal engineering
* Clear outcome: internal reprogramming that sticks — not coping tools or external advice
* Confidential space for complex emotional, behavioral, or compulsive patterns

> *"Other programs help you cope. We rewrite the code."*

---

## 🚀 Performance ROI (New Section)

Clients who complete You.v2 often report:

* Relief from internal noise, mental clutter, overthinking
* Increased energy, clarity, and emotional bandwidth
* Visible shifts in relationships and parenting presence
* Re-engagement with long-stalled goals or decisions
* A "sense of quiet power" that replaces burnout-driven urgency

> "In 17 days, I went from pushing through life to actually acting from my own center."

Include client-facing visuals (before/after focus, clarity bar, decision fatigue meter).
