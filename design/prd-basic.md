Perfect. Below is a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for building the **you-v2.com** landing page.

This version integrates a refined emotional and strategic focus on **high-functioning survivors of difficult childhoods**, particularly those from post-Soviet or emigrant backgrounds, who have succeeded externally but carry internal legacy burdens. It preserves the structured, premium tech-like framing while speaking directly to those who believed they would have to live with this pain forever — until now.

## 📌 Page Structure (Key Sections Only — Updated Tone)

### 1. **Hero Section**

* **Headline:** `You overcame everything. But the past still haunts you.`

* **Subheadline:**
  `You.v2 is a 17-day subconscious reprogramming protocol. Built for those who are done guessing, pushing, and repeating loops that no longer make sense.`

* **Clarifying Line:** `Old internal rules protected you once. Now they distort your clarity, energy, and connection.`

* **CTA:** `📅 Book Strategy Call`

* **Anchor Phrase Below CTA:**
  *"You thought this would go on forever. It doesn't have to."*

### 2. **Problem Section**

> "You did everything to break the cycle. But when your kid looks at you with that same anger or withdrawal you used to feel — you wonder if the cycle is breaking you."

**Headline:**
`You're not lazy. You're not broken. You're running old code.`

**Key pains:**

* You built your success by fighting through every obstacle. Now it feels like the fight is inside you.
* You swore not to become like your parents — and yet you see it leak out in moments with your kids.
* You've made it, but can't relax. Or connect. Or feel.
* You feel time passing. Success behind you. But what's next?
* You've done therapy. You've read the books. Still, something holds.
* You've tried to stay in control — but the pressure leaks sideways: into food, distractions, work, sex, compulsive habits. You know it's not about the behavior. It's something deeper — and private.

**Paragraph:**

> What you're dealing with isn't lack of discipline. It's legacy code — strategies that once helped you cope but now sabotage your clarity and drive.

> Most people never question that internal noise — they just push through it. But pushing only takes you so far.

### 3. **How It Works — Subconscious Reboot**

* **Headline:** `This isn't therapy. It's reprogramming.`

> Your subconscious is your internal operating system — and it was installed before you had a say. It runs your emotions, your impulses, your loyalties.
>
> Logic doesn't reach it. Coaching can't override it. Motivation bounces off it. That's why most change fails — or exhausts you.
>
> Between your conscious and your subconscious is a firewall: the critical factor. It protects old identity code. Until we bypass it, you'll stay loyal to beliefs you no longer need.
>
> You.v2 uses deep system-level interventions to rewrite that code — precisely, calmly, permanently.

* **Tagline:** *We don't fix symptoms. We reprogram the system.*

* **Dilts Pyramid Suggestion:**

  ```
  Behavior  
  Capabilities  
  → Beliefs  
  → Identity  
  → Purpose  
  ```

  *"You've worked hard at the behavior level. It's time to reset where it actually matters."*
