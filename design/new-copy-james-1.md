# You.v2

Main points:
- update copy to be more results-oriented
- mention that this program is specifically developed for Russian-speaking expats, because first language is best for subconscious change, even if you live and think in English. you need someone who understands your current life challenges but can talk to your subconscious mind in your first language.
- this is a good fit for trainers, coaches, therapists, doctors, lawyers - people who help other people every day but feel that they have their own unresolved issues

## You lead, guide, and support others — but you know it’s time to focus on yourself.
## (RU) Вы ведёте, направляете и поддерживаете других — но чувствуете, что пора уделить внимание себе.

*A structured and personalized hypnotherapy approach to end self-sabotage by working directly with your subconscious — where real change begins.*

Your subconscious mind holds the patterns that keep you stuck — and the power to change everything.

You don’t need more willpower. You need access to the part of your mind where real change begins.

You’ve done the mindset work. You’ve tried therapy. But something deeper still holds you back.

It’s time to work with your subconscious mind — where lasting change begins.

---

## What You’ll Gain
Through this work, I’ll teach you how to access and use the power of your own subconscious mind — so that you can stop self-sabotaging, achieve your goals more easily, and continue creating meaningful change long after our work is done.


### My Vision
My work is about more than personal change. It’s about breaking generational patterns, removing invisible blocks, and making sure that the pain you carry doesn’t get passed down. My mission is to create more happy people around me by liberating them from their subconscious limiting beliefs and patterns that no longer serve them.

---

## Is This For You?
- You’ve outgrown traditional mindset tools
- You feel stuck despite external success
- You’re ready to do deep work with lasting impact
- You help others every day, but it's time you focus on your own transformation

This work is especially effective for people in helping roles — coaches, therapists, doctors, lawyers, business leaders — because you understand change, and you’re ready to do the work that goes beyond what most methods can reach.

This work is for people who are truly ready. Not to talk, circle, or hope — but to actually change.

## What issues we can work with

I work with professionals who have achieved a lot — yet still feel that something isn’t right beneath the surface. Here are just a few areas where subconscious reprogramming can create powerful change:

### 📍 External success — but love feels impossible

You’ve built a career, solved big problems, earned respect. But in relationships, you keep hitting the same walls: distance, pain, self-doubt. It’s not bad luck — it’s deeper than that.


### 📍 Money comes — and then disappears

You earn well, but you can’t grow further. Fear of big numbers, guilt around success, inner conflict between safety and freedom — this isn’t about the market. It’s about your internal structure.


### 📍 You — or someone close — suddenly changed

After an illness, surgery, accident, or even intense stress, something feels off. Like part of you is missing. This work helps with what logic can’t explain.


### 📍 You don’t want to become your parents — but you’re already repeating them

Guilt, frustration, emotional distance with your child — these often echo patterns you lived through yourself. We can stop inherited pain from passing forward.


### 📍 You can’t feel at home in your body

Discomfort with your image, shame about weight or skin, self-criticism, obsessive habits — these aren’t willpower problems. They’re deeper than that.


Every person is different. If you don’t see your situation here — reach out. I don’t treat diagnoses or give labels. Every story can be rewritten.

## This Isn’t Coaching. This Is Clinical-Grade Precision.

I don’t follow scripts. I don’t work from templates. This isn’t about motivation or mindset — it’s about reprogramming the systems that run your inner world.

- **It’s deep because it has to be.**
I work at the level where real patterns live — and that takes more skill, more care, and more responsibility than surface-level tools.

- **I’ve seen the edge — and know when to stop.**
I’ve worked with real psychiatric and cognitive cases. I know when something is outside scope — and I know what’s safe.

- **This isn’t just knowledge. It’s lived expertise.**
Medical training. Systems thinking. Subconscious work. Clinical research. This isn’t a method I bought — it’s the result of everything I’ve studied, seen, and tested in real life.

- **I’ve Been There — That’s Why I Know It Works.**
I’ve done this work myself. I know what it’s like to carry patterns you didn’t choose — and to break them. That’s why I take this process seriously. It’s not theory. It’s personal.

## Two Paths, One Transformation

You.v2 is a high-touch, personalized hypnotherapy experience designed for powerful, high-functioning people who are ready to stop self-sabotage and step fully into aligned living.

Some prefer an immersive experience. Others need spacious integration.

That’s why I offer two pathways to the same transformation:

### 🔥 The 17-Day Intensive (Premium Tier)

For those who are ready to go all in.

* **Fast, immersive format** — sessions every 2–3 days
* **Deep containment** and momentum
* **Requires full emotional commitment** and calendar priority
* **Ideal for founders, creatives, and leaders in transition or crisis**

> *“If you want a complete system reset — and you’re ready now — this is the path.”*

**Pricing:** Premium-tier investment. Only 2 clients accepted per month.

---

### 🌱 The 6-Week Repatterning (Core Tier)

For those who want transformation with integration.

* Weekly 1:1 sessions over 6 weeks
* Time to reflect, observe, and stabilize between sessions
* Same framework, adapted to your nervous system’s pace
* Ideal for high-achievers managing life demands alongside deep work

> *“If you want to go deep without overwhelm, this is your space.”*

**Pricing:** Core-tier investment. Only 4 clients accepted per month.

---

## Same Framework. Two Paces.

Both paths follow the same internal architecture:

* Mapping your symbolic and emotional terrain
* Uncovering root beliefs and patterns
* Rewiring subconscious pathways through trance-based work
* Integrating new internal logic and long-term access tools

This is not mindset coaching. This is subconscious repatterning — done with surgical precision and deep containment.

## Why Work With Me

My role is not to fix you. It’s to help you unlock what’s already within.

I live and thrive between worlds — between English and Russian, medicine and engineering, the scientific and the spiritual. That’s why I can guide you through transformation that’s not only deep - but precise, not just emotional - but effective.

- **Depth and speed:** Profound change doesn’t need to take years. My clients experience deep shifts in weeks, not months.

- **Clinical rigor meets inner wisdom:** As a physician with postdoctoral training at Yale and UCSD, I integrate scientific depth with intuitive precision — minus the fluff.

- **Safe masculine presence:** For both powerful women and high-performing men — I create a judgment-free and non-threatening space where you can feel safe, supported, and respected.

- **Bilingual and bicultural:** This program was specifically developed for Russian speaking expats navigating life between two cultures. Even if you think in English today, your inner child still speaks Russian. But you also need someone who can understand the realities of your today's life.

- **Nothing is too much:** We’ll address the things you’ve never said out loud — without fear, shame, or avoidance. The work can be context-free: you only share what you can safely share.

- **Both art and science:** No pre-determined templates or scripts, because every person is different and every session is different. Together, we will craft and go through a process which reflects your mind and your life - not somebody else's.
